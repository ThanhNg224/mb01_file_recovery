# Deep Scan Improvements

## Overview
The deep scan has been significantly enhanced to provide much more comprehensive file recovery capabilities compared to the quick scan.

## What Makes Deep Scan Better Than Quick Scan

### Quick Scan (Basic)
- Only scans MediaStore database
- Finds files that are indexed by the system
- Fast but limited coverage
- Misses hidden, deleted, and unindexed files

### Deep Scan (Enhanced)
The deep scan now includes **5 comprehensive scanning phases**:

## 1. Regular MediaStore Scan
- Same as quick scan (baseline coverage)
- Scans all indexed images, videos, and documents

## 2. Hidden Files Detection ‚ú®
**NEW: Scans for hidden files in:**
- System hidden directories (`.hidden`, `.trash`, `.recycle`, `.thumbnails`)
- App-specific hidden folders:
  - `.WhatsApp`
  - `.Telegram`
  - `.Instagram`
  - `.Facebook`
  - `.Snapchat`
  - `.TikTok`
- Files starting with "." (dot files)
- Directories with `.nomedia` files (hidden from gallery apps)
- Camera and picture thumbnail caches

## 3. Trash Bin & Recycle Bin Scanning üóëÔ∏è
**NEW: Comprehensive trash directory scanning:**

### System Trash Locations
- `/storage/emulated/0/.Trash`
- `/storage/emulated/0/Trash`
- `/storage/emulated/0/RECYCLE.BIN`
- `/storage/emulated/0/.Trash-1000` (user-specific trash)

### App Trash Locations
- **File Managers**: ES File Explorer, File Manager, ASUS FileManager, MiDrive
- **Gallery Apps**: DCIM/Trash, Pictures/Trash, Pictures/.trashed
- **Cloud Storage**: Google Drive, Dropbox local trash
- **Social Media**: WhatsApp, Telegram, Instagram trash folders
- **MediaStore**: Android system media provider trash cache

### Smart Detection
- Automatically finds any directory with "trash", "deleted", "recycle", or "bin" in the name
- Scans all subdirectories recursively

## 4. Deleted Files Recovery üîÑ
**NEW: Multiple approaches to find deleted files:**

### Orphaned Files Detection
- Finds files still in MediaStore database but physically deleted
- Scans last 1000 modified files for orphaned entries
- Useful for recently deleted files not yet purged from database

### Temporary & Pending Directories
- `/Android/data/com.android.providers.media/files/.pending`
- `/Android/data/com.android.providers.media/files/.deleted`
- Temporary directories (`.temp`, `tmp`, `.tmp`)
- App cache directories (Gallery, Google Photos)

### Backup Directories
- `.backup`
- `backup`
- `Backups`
- `Android/data/backup`

### Android 11+ Features
- Uses MediaStore deleted files API (if available)
- Scans files modified in last 30 days for deletion markers

## 5. Unindexed Files Discovery üìÅ
**NEW: Scans for files not in MediaStore:**

### Standard Directories
- Download/Downloads
- Documents
- Music, Movies, Pictures
- DCIM (Camera, Screenshots)

### Messaging Apps
- WhatsApp Media (Images, Videos, Documents)
- Telegram (Images, Videos, Documents)
- Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok
- Facebook, Twitter

### Other Sources
- Bluetooth transfers
- Voice/Call Recordings
- App data directories (`Android/data`, `Android/media`)
- SD card paths (`/storage/sdcard1`, `/mnt/extSdCard`)
- Custom user folders (Media, Files, MyFiles)

### Root Storage Scan
- Scans root storage for unindexed files
- Automatically detects custom media directories
- Finds files in unusual locations

## Technical Improvements

### Duplicate Prevention
- All found files are deduplicated by URI
- Prevents showing the same file multiple times from different scan phases

### Smart Filtering
- All scan phases respect user filters (file type, size, date range)
- Consistent filtering across all scan methods

### Performance Optimization
- Recursive directory scanning with error handling
- Graceful handling of permission issues
- Extensive logging for debugging

### File Type Detection
- MIME type detection from file extensions
- Proper MediaKind classification (IMAGE, VIDEO, DOCUMENT, AUDIO, OTHER)
- Support for common formats: jpg, png, gif, mp4, avi, pdf, doc, xls, etc.

## Expected Results

### Files the Deep Scan Can Now Find:
‚úÖ Hidden photos/videos in app folders  
‚úÖ Files in trash bins (not yet permanently deleted)  
‚úÖ Recently deleted files still in temp directories  
‚úÖ Orphaned database entries  
‚úÖ Unindexed files from downloads or transfers  
‚úÖ Files in `.nomedia` directories  
‚úÖ Cache and backup copies  
‚úÖ Files on external SD cards  
‚úÖ Social media app cached media  
‚úÖ Bluetooth transferred files  

### What Deep Scan Still Cannot Find:
‚ùå Permanently deleted files (overwritten data)  
‚ùå Files in encrypted app containers without root  
‚ùå Files in system partitions without root access  
‚ùå Corrupted files with no valid headers  

## Permissions Required

For best results, the deep scan needs:
- `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` (Android 10 and below)
- `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` (Android 11+) - for full file system access
- Without these permissions, some directories may not be accessible

## Logging

All scan operations are logged with tags:
- "MediaRepository" - Main scanning operations
- Each scan phase logs how many files it found
- Inaccessible directories are logged for debugging

## Conclusion

The enhanced deep scan is now **significantly more powerful** than the quick scan, with the ability to find:
- Hidden files in dozens of locations
- Trash bin files from system and apps
- Recently deleted files
- Orphaned database entries
- Unindexed files across the entire storage

This makes it a true "recovery" tool rather than just a file browser.
